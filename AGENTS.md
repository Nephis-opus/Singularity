# AI Agent Instructions for Singularity Workspace

## 🏷️ Repository Identity & Distinction
There are two distinct repositories/forks — maintaining clear separation is strictly mandatory:
- **NEPHIS-Sing (`https://github.com/Nephis-opus/Singularity`) [THIS WORKSPACE]**:
  - The canonical, active workspace repository.
  - Fully built and developed by Nephis / InsomniacZero.
  - Heavy focus on user-friendliness, streamlined pure-Python architecture (`StarletteGateway` / zero Rust compilation on mobile), unified Control Center & Playground UI, and Tavern integration.
- **NISTE-sing & DOMCORD-CARDS [ISOLATED REFERENCES]**:
  - `niste-sing/` and `Domcord-Cards/` are pulled/extracted strictly for reference, protocol inspection, or comparative reverse-engineering.
  - **Rule**: Never import, execute, or mix files from `niste-sing/`, `legacy/`, or `Domcord-Cards/` directly into NEPHIS-Sing runtime code. All runtime code must live purely in `singularity/`.

## ⚠️ Essential Project Rules
1. **NO GIT PUSH**: Never push code or tokens to GitHub (`git push` is forbidden unless explicitly asked by the user).
2. **NO BROWSER / CHROME AUTOMATION**: Do not open Chrome or use browser subagents unless explicitly instructed.
3. **PREFER REPO CLI (`./singular` or `./c2a`)**: When checking accounts, verifying quotas/limits, testing models, checking status, or toggling simulation mode, **DO NOT** write multi-line Python scratch scripts or raw curl commands. **Always use the built-in `./singular` (or `./c2a`) CLI tool**.
4. **NO LEGACY / NISTE-SING / DOMCORD-CARDS DEPENDENCIES**: The Singularity workspace is 100% self-contained in `singularity/`. Do not import, execute, or link against files from `legacy/`, `niste-sing/`, or `Domcord-Cards/`.
5. **ZERO RUST BUILD TOOLCHAINS ON MOBILE**: Singularity runs on pure Python with `StarletteGateway` and `uvicorn`. Never add `pydantic` or `fastapi` to `requirements.txt`. Startup dependency checks must verify pure packages (`starlette, uvicorn, httpx`) so phone installation completes in 3–5 seconds without Cargo/Rust compilation.
6. **ARCHITECTURE MANUAL**: Consult [ARCHITECTURE.md](file:///home/insomniac/Desktop/Janitor/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full architectural blueprint, request lifecycle, engine protocol specifications, and data flow pipelines.

## 🚀 Singularity Unified CLI (`./singular` / `./c2a`) Quick Cheat Sheet
The unified tool is located directly in the repository root:
`./singular` (also symlinked as `./c2a` for backward compatibility)

You can run it directly from bash in the repository root:

```bash
cd "/home/insomniac/Desktop/UNI/Apps/Gemini Web2Api/Singularity"

# 1. Inspect Fleet Status & Database Vault
./singular status                    # Live status of all 8 providers & accounts summary
./singular status --json             # Compact JSON output for scripting

# 2. Live Limits & Quotas Across All Providers
./singular limits                    # ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Kimi, GLM, DeepSeek, Qwen quotas
./singular limits --json             # Structured JSON limits payload

# 3. Account Vault Management (SQLite)
./singular accounts                  # List all stacked accounts across providers
./singular accounts chatgpt          # Filter accounts by provider (chatgpt, kimi, claude, deepseek, etc.)
./singular import <path_or_json>     # Import credentials dump into SQLite vault
./singular export [backup.json]      # Export portable credential vault to JSON

# 4. Device Simulation Mode (Portable / Offline Testing)
./singular simulate on               # Enable simulation mode (test all 216 models without backends)
./singular simulate off              # Disable simulation mode (connect to live backends)
./singular simulate status           # Check current simulation state

# 5. Fast Model Inference & Testing
./singular chat "What is 2+2?" -m gpt-5-6-mini       # Quick streaming chat test
./singular chat "Hello" -m gemini-3.8-flash           # Gemini test
./singular chat "Explain quantum computing" --simulate # Force simulated completion

# 6. Gateway Server Control (Dual-boots Singularity :9000 + Tavern Studio :5173)
./start.sh                           # Linux / macOS / Termux
start.bat                            # Windows (native cmd/powershell)

# 7. Cloud Tunnel & Native Remote Mobile Access (ngrok)
./singular tunnel                    # Inspect tunnel state & public HTTPS URL
./singular tunnel start              # Expose gateway securely to the internet
./singular tunnel stop               # Stop active public tunnel
./singular tunnel install            # Auto-install native ngrok binary (Phone Termux / PC)
./singular tunnel token <token>      # Set ngrok authtoken
```

## 🛠️ Protocol for Adding a New AI Provider to Singularity

When expanding Singularity to support a new AI provider (e.g. 8th, 9th provider):

### 1. Zero Legacy Runtime Dependencies
- If a reference repo is cloned into `legacy/` (e.g. `legacy/<repo>`), use it **only** to study API contracts, signatures, and protocols.
- **Never** import, execute, or link against `legacy/`. All runtime code must live in `singularity/`.

### 2. Strict One-File Engine Rule (`singularity/engines/`)
- Every provider must have **strictly ONE file** in `singularity/engines/`: `singularity/engines/<provider>.py`.
- **Do not scatter auxiliary scripts** (no extra `.js`, `.py`, or `.sh` files in `engines/`).
- Any sub-processes (e.g. Node.js PoW solvers, WASM execution scripts) must be embedded as inline constants within `<provider>.py`.
- Binary assets (e.g. `.wasm` modules) belong in `singularity/data/` and **must be unignored** in `.gitignore` (`!singularity/data/*.wasm`) so they are tracked by git.

### 3. Exhaustive Model Discovery & Web Research
- **Never assume legacy models are the latest.** Always run targeted web searches for:
  - Current-year model releases (e.g. V4, V4.1, Flash, Pro, Reasoner).
  - Official API aliases and web endpoints.
  - Context window capacities, vision/multimodal capabilities, and thinking/CoT features.
- Register every model in `MODELS_CATALOG` in [`singularity/providers.py`](file:///home/insomniac/Desktop/UNI/Apps/Gemini%20Web2Api/Singularity/singularity/providers.py).
- Register all model prefixes and aliases in `resolve_model_provider()` in [`singularity/server.py`](file:///home/insomniac/Desktop/UNI/Apps/Gemini%20Web2Api/Singularity/singularity/server.py).

### 4. Realistic & Non-Hallucinated Limits
- Do not fabricate arbitrary limits. Query the provider's live user profile / limits API (`/users/current`, etc.) using credentials if available.
- Reflect exact capabilities (Reasoning, Web Search, File Upload size/count, Concurrency, Reset Windows) in `get_all_limits()` in [`singularity/providers.py`](file:///home/insomniac/Desktop/UNI/Apps/Gemini%20Web2Api/Singularity/singularity/providers.py).

### 5. SQLite Credential Vault Support
- Add the provider parser to `parse_credential()` in [`singularity/db.py`](file:///home/insomniac/Desktop/UNI/Apps/Gemini%20Web2Api/Singularity/singularity/db.py).
- Ensure it flexibly handles raw token strings, full JSON dumps, localStorage key-value objects (e.g. `{"value": "...", "__version": "0"}`), and JWTs.

### 6. Full Gateway & Control Center Integration
- Add provider configuration to `PROVIDERS_CONFIG` in `providers.py` (port, badge, color, host).
- Add SVG icon to `singularity/static/icons/<provider>.svg`.
- Update Control Center UI in `singularity/static/index.html` and `singularity/static/app.js` (filter pills, cookie stacker tabs, token guides).
- Test both simulated (`--simulate`) and live inference using `./singular chat`.
- Confirm fleet health via `./singular status` and `./singular limits`.

## 📝 Post-Mortem & Mistakes Log (Lessons Learned)

Keep these past failures in mind to avoid repeating them:

1. **Incomplete Model Discovery (Surface-Level Research)**:
   - *Mistake*: During DeepSeek integration, research stopped at the V3/R1 baseline found in the legacy reference repo, completely missing the newly released V4, V4-Pro, and V4.1-Flash models until the user pointed it out.
   - *Lesson*: Always execute thorough web searches focused specifically on the newest releases, current year changes, and active aliases before writing the model catalog.

2. **Engine Directory Clutter**:
   - *Mistake*: Created `deepseek_pow.js` and `deepseek_pow.py` in `singularity/engines/`, breaking the clean architecture where each provider has exactly one unified driver file.
   - *Lesson*: Keep `singularity/engines/` strictly one-file per provider (`<provider>.py`). Inline auxiliary Node.js or shell helpers directly in the Python module.

3. **Untracked Binary Assets in Git**:
   - *Mistake*: Placed the required WebAssembly binary in `singularity/data/` while `singularity/data/` was ignored in `.gitignore`, risking a broken deployment on fresh clones.
   - *Lesson*: Whenever placing native runtime assets in data folders, explicitly whitelist them in `.gitignore` (e.g. `!singularity/data/*.wasm`).

4. **Blindly Copying Outdated Reference Headers**:
   - *Mistake*: Copied old Android client headers (`DeepSeek/1.0.13 Android/35`) from the reference repo, causing the live API to reject requests with `CLIENT_VERSION_TOO_LOW`.
   - *Lesson*: Modern web APIs change client versions frequently. Always verify against current browser client headers (`x-client-platform: web`, modern User-Agents).

5. **Self-Recursive Worker Forwarding Loops**:
   - *Mistake*: Left an upstream check inside the engine that forwarded requests to port 8088 when the engine itself was running inside the 8088 worker, causing an infinite loop.
   - *Lesson*: Engine files are the backend implementations themselves; they must execute the native Web2API reverse-proxy logic directly.

6. **Dependency Creep & Mobile Rust Build Trap**:
   - *Mistake*: Inadvertently adding `fastapi` and `pydantic` to `requirements.txt`. On Android (Termux), `pip install` pulls `pydantic-core`, which attempts to compile Rust via `cargo`, hanging for hours on phones.
   - *Lesson*: Singularity runs on pure Python with `StarletteGateway` and `uvicorn`. Never add `pydantic` or `fastapi`. Keep `requirements.txt` strictly lightweight and pure Python so phone installations take 3–5 seconds.

7. **Termux Kernel vs Userspace Architecture Mismatch (`[Errno 8] Exec format error`)**:
   - *Mistake*: Relying solely on `uname -m` to select native binaries (e.g. ngrok) on Android Termux. On many phones, a 64-bit kernel (`aarch64`) runs a 32-bit Termux userspace (`arm` / `armhf`). Attempting to execute a 64-bit ELF binary on a 32-bit userland crashes with `[Errno 8] Exec format error`. Furthermore, checking `os.access(..., os.X_OK)` returns `True` even for mismatched ELF architectures.
   - *Lesson*: Detect userspace architecture using `dpkg --print-architecture` and pointer width (`sys.maxsize > 2**32`). Always test execution via `is_binary_runnable` (`ngrok version`) before using a binary, provide automatic fallback between 64-bit and 32-bit ARM, and auto-purge broken binaries on startup.

8. **Windows Batch Parenthesis & Ampersand Traps**:
   - *Mistake*: Placing raw parentheses inside CMD `if (...)` blocks in Windows `.bat` scripts (e.g. `echo Please install Node.js (v22+)`). In `cmd.exe`, an unescaped `)` prematurely terminates the `if` block and crashes with syntax errors.
   - *Lesson*: Never use raw parentheses inside `if (...)` blocks in `.bat` files. Use square brackets `[v22+]` or escape them `^)`. Always escape ampersands `^&` in echo statements.

9. **Universal GenUI Interception (`※genui※`) & Artifact Sandboxing**:
   - *Mistake*: ChatGPT web canvas outputs raw `※genui※{"app_block":...}※` JSON payloads directly into chat bubbles, and error boundaries placed below the fold hide React failures.
   - *Lesson*: Always route GenUI blocks through `singularity/artifacts.py` to auto-convert to `<antArtifact>`, use programmatic Babel compilation instead of DOM scanner scripts, and fix error boundaries at `top: 16px; z-index: 999999`. The artifact iframe must **never** get `allow-same-origin` (see lesson 24): keep `<base href>` + absolute `/static/vendor/*` paths with CDN fallbacks, and route every artifact type through `withSandboxShims()` so storage APIs work in the opaque origin.

10. **Canonical Dual-Launcher Invariant (`start.sh` and `start.bat`)**:
    - *Mistake*: Creating multiple ad-hoc startup scripts (`start_singularity.sh`, `singular.bat`) when users request running from arbitrary directories.
    - *Lesson*: Singularity maintains strictly two canonical launchers: `start.sh` (symlinked as `singular` for Unix/Termux) and `start.bat` for Windows. Both handle co-startup of Singularity and optional Tavern, auto-detect dependencies, and clean up child processes on exit. `start.command` is only a macOS double-click shim that `cd`s to the repo and `exec`s `start.sh`; never put launcher logic in it.

11. **Module-Level Imports for Archive Extraction Handlers (`tarfile`, `zipfile`)**:
    - *Mistake*: Calling `tarfile.open()` inside an installer helper without `import tarfile` at the top of the file, causing runtime crashes (`name 'tarfile' is not defined`) when unpacking `.tgz` binaries on Android/Linux.
    - *Lesson*: Always import standard library archive tools (`tarfile`, `zipfile`) at module level and run an AST-based undefined-variable check on any newly added functions before shipping.

12. **Termux Current Directory vs. Global PATH Command Execution**:
    - *Mistake*: Typing `singular` or `singularity` directly in `~/Singularity` before initial launch fails with `command not found` because `.` is not in `$PATH`.
    - *Lesson*: First-time boot requires `./start.sh` (or `bash install.sh`). `start.sh` automatically establishes global symlinks in `$PREFIX/bin/singular`, `$PREFIX/bin/singularity`, and `$PREFIX/bin/c2a` so subsequent executions work globally without `./`.

13. **ChatGPT Web Image Generation Block in Temporary Chats & Direct Estuary CDN 403**:
    - *Mistake*: Selecting image models like `gpt-image-2.5-flare` failed with *"image generation isn't available in this temporary chat"*. This was caused by hardcoding `history_and_training_disabled: True` in OpenAI payload (OpenAI strictly disables DALL-E in temporary chats) and direct browser loading of `backend-api/estuary` URLs which return 403 without session cookies.
    - *Lesson*: For image models, dynamically toggle `history_and_training_disabled: not is_image_model`, add `system_hints: ["picture_v2"]`, download the image binary in the authenticated session, persist to `singularity/static/generated/`, stream base64 data URIs, and auto-hide the conversation via `PATCH /backend-api/conversation/{conv_id}` with `{"is_visible": False}`.

14. **Generated Image Viewport UI & Clean Floating Action Overlays**:
    - *Mistake*: Encasing AI-generated images inside bloated cards with extra border outlines and footer caption bars ("Neural Synthesis", redundant prompt text).
    - *Lesson*: Present generated images cleanly with rounded corners (`border-radius: 16px`), no caption footer, and a sleek floating top-right frosted glass overlay containing only **Copy** (with checkmark feedback) and **Download** SVG buttons with tooltips.

15. **High-Definition WebGL Fluid Simulation & Theme Adaptive Palette**:
    - *Mistake*: Checking `document.body.getAttribute('data-theme')` instead of `document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-theme')`, causing light mode to falsely register as dark mode and rendering black patches instead of clean white; and hardcoding pitch black instead of the UI's theme primary dark `#141414`.
    - *Lesson*: For image generation loading, check theme on `document.documentElement` (`document.documentElement.getAttribute('data-theme') || document.body.getAttribute('data-theme')`). In Light Mode, replace all dark/black elements with pure white (`#ffffff`) and soft whitish (`#fcfbfa`) with terracotta `#d97757` streams folding and merging into white fluid (zero black patches!). In Dark Mode, use the UI's dark background `#141414` (from tokens `--bg-primary`) with luminous terracotta streams. Render with GPU-accelerated WebGL using analytical harmonic vortex potential flow at native Retina resolution with strictly autonomous motion, "Creating image" header, dynamic aspect ratio, and frosted progress pill. On completion, `finish()` deallocates WebGL shaders and the final image pop-fades in.

16. **Dark Mode User Bubbles & Whitened UI Action Controls**:
    - *Mistake*: Dark mode user messages blending into generic dark gray backgrounds, with action buttons and top header settings icons being too dim (`var(--text-muted)` = `#78716c`), causing poor contrast and muddy appearance.
    - *Lesson*: In dark mode, style user message bubbles with brand terracotta `#d97757` and crisp white text. Whiten response action buttons (`.response-actions`), user message hover controls (`.user-msg-actions`), and top header settings buttons (`.claude-icon-btn`, `.claude-avatar-btn`) to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85-0.92)` / `#ffffff` on hover, while keeping date timestamps subtly muted (`var(--text-muted)`).

17. **Google Omni Multimodal & Veo Cinematic Video Model Integration**:
    - *Mistake*: Overlooking Google DeepMind's frontier generative media family beyond text (`Google Omni` and `Veo`), causing video and conversational multimodal queries to miss specialized model routing and capabilities.
    - *Lesson*: Register the complete **Google Omni** family (`gemini-omni-flash`, `gemini-omni-1.1-flash`, `gemini-omni-pro`, `google-omni`) and **Veo** family (`veo-3.1-generate-preview`, `veo-3.1-fast-generate-preview`, `veo-3.1-lite`, `veo-3.0`, `veo-2.0-generate-001`, `veo-2`) across `MODELS_CATALOG` (`singularity/providers.py`), `resolve_model_provider()` & `_get_simulated_response_payload()` (`singularity/server.py`), `MODEL_CONFIGS` (`singularity/engines/gemini.py`), and `get_all_limits()` with verified video quotas and any-to-any multimodal capabilities.

18. **Strict Real-Live Testing Rule & Elimination of Fake Simulated Responses**:
    - *Mistake*: Testing model endpoints and fixes using `--simulate` instead of authentic live upstream requests. The user explicitly forbids fake simulated responses.
    - *Lesson*: NEVER test with `--simulate`. Always execute real live test queries against the running server/engine using `./singular chat "<prompt>" -m <model>` to verify authentic network calls, cookie authentication, response tokens, and media downloads.

19. **Google Gemini Batchexecute SNlM0e XSRF Token & ALR Image Pipeline**:
    - *Mistake*: Gemini `StreamGenerate` calls failing with HTTP 400 (`[["er",null,null,null,null,400,null,null,null,3,[{"48448350":["xsrf","..."]}]]]`) and image generation failing with guest mode refusal ("It's possible you're signed out or image creation isn't available").
    - *Lesson*: Gemini's `StreamGenerate` endpoint strictly requires the `at` parameter (`SNlM0e` XSRF token) and modern `bl` build label. Dynamically extract `SNlM0e` and `bl` from `https://gemini.google.com/app` using active session cookies (`__Secure-1PSID`), auto-heal by extracting the new xsrf token from 400 response bodies if rotation occurs, and resolve generated `https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gg-dl/...` images through authenticated App Layer Redirection (`=d-I?alr=yes`) hops to download the binary and stream high-definition base64 data URIs.

20. **Google Gemini `__Secure-1PSIDTS` Cookie Requirement & Multi-Account Rotation**:
    - *Mistake*: Omitting `__Secure-1PSIDTS` when copying Gemini cookies from browser DevTools, causing Google to treat the session as unauthenticated guest mode and refuse image generation ("Are you signed in? I can search for images, but can't seem to create any for you right now"). Furthermore, hardcoding `accounts[0]` in ascending order prevented newly pasted accounts from taking effect.
    - *Lesson*: Always sort vault accounts `ORDER BY id DESC` so recently pasted credentials take precedence. Require and validate `__Secure-1PSIDTS` alongside `__Secure-1PSID`, dynamically rotate across all accounts to locate an active authenticated `SNlM0e` session, surface UI/CLI warnings when `__Secure-1PSIDTS` is missing, and pre-emptively guide the user with a 30-second fix if an image model is requested while signed out.

21. **Google Gemini `SAPISIDHASH` Authentication & Full Cookie Bundle Support**:
    - *Mistake*: Assuming `__Secure-1PSID` and `__Secure-1PSIDTS` alone are always sufficient for Google's authenticated image endpoints. Google Web endpoints require the `Authorization: SAPISIDHASH <ts>_<sha1>` header (derived from the `SAPISID` cookie) and validate the complete cookie bundle (`SID`, `__Secure-1PSID`, `__Secure-1PSIDTS`, `SAPISID`, etc.). Prematurely returning an abort notice blocked live execution and auto-healing.
    - *Lesson*: Do not prematurely abort image requests before sending them to Gemini; allow requests to reach the backend so auto-healing and token recovery can execute. Extract `SAPISID`, `__Secure-1PAPISID`, or `__Secure-3PAPISID` from candidate cookies if present, and dynamically compute and attach the `Authorization: SAPISIDHASH <timestamp>_<sha1>` header for `https://gemini.google.com`. Recommend copying the full `Cookie:` header from the browser's Network tab (`F12` -> Network -> any Gemini request -> Request Headers -> Cookie). Only replace Google's signed-out / location refusal message if no generated images were emitted (`not emitted_images`).

22. **Unclosed Modal Parent Container & Global Delegation for Icon Buttons**:
    - *Mistake*: Clicking the top-right gear icon (`#btn-open-settings`) failed to show the Claude Settings Modal. A missing `</div>` on the preceding `#playground-lightbox` container caused `#claude-settings-modal` to be parsed as a child of `.lightbox-modal`, inheriting its closed state (`opacity: 0; pointer-events: none;`). Additionally, `initUserProfile` was not hoisted, and clicks on the inner SVG/path tags weren't delegating cleanly.
    - *Lesson*: Run strict tag balancing verification on HTML documents containing modal backdrops. Ensure all fixed modals are direct top-level siblings. Declare hoisted wrapper functions (`function initUserProfile() { return initClaudeSettings(); }`), invoke `initClaudeSettings()` directly in `DOMContentLoaded`, and attach global event delegation with `e.target.closest('#btn-open-settings, .claude-settings-gear-btn')` so clicks on child SVG icons and paths open modals reliably.

23. **Custom Model Selector Lifecycle Re-rendering & Segmented Theme Capsule Geometry**:
    - *Mistake*: The chat playground model switcher popover displayed an empty box below the search input because `renderCustomSelectOptions()` was only called once at startup without a re-render trigger on click, leaving it blank if `/api/models` completed asynchronously. Additionally, the popover stuck right to the button with an awkward offset, and the theme segmented control in Settings lacked explicit width, collapsing the indicator into a squished vertical oval.
    - *Lesson*: Always re-render custom dropdown contents (`renderCustomSelectOptions()`) upon opening the trigger, provide fallback loading states if catalogs are in flight, add checkmark indicators and provider chips for active models, offset popovers with clean 12px breathing room (`bottom: calc(100% + 12px)`), and enforce fixed minimum geometry (`width: 132px; height: 38px;`) on segmented controls so capsule indicators glide horizontally with correct aspect ratio.

24. **Gateway Security Invariants (Full Audit, 2026-09-26)**:
    - *Mistake*: Every `/api/*` route (including `/api/cookies/export`) was unauthenticated with `CORS *`, the gateway bound `0.0.0.0`, the ngrok tunnel had no auth, the artifact iframe had no sandbox (and `allow-same-origin` was mandated), Gemini sent Google cookies to any `.mp4` URL in model output, and tokens/session keys sat in plaintext (including in the `identifier` column). Any website, LAN peer, or prompt-injected artifact could steal every stored session.
    - *Lesson*: Keep `singularity/security.py` as the single access policy (loopback-trusted, gateway key or session cookie otherwise, foreign `Origin`/`Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site` refused) and never add `CORSMiddleware(allow_origins=["*"])` back. Default binds are `127.0.0.1`; LAN is opt-in via `--lan`. Store secrets only through `db.save_account()` / `db.set_setting()` (which encrypt via `singularity/vault.py`); never write a secret-derived value into `identifier`. Artifacts render only inside the opaque-origin sandbox, never via `innerHTML` in the dashboard. Engines must allowlist hosts before attaching provider cookies to any URL taken from a response. `POST /api/config` only accepts keys in `API_WRITABLE_SETTINGS`.

25. **Expired ChatGPT Session Tokens (Sentinel 401) & Silent Full-Pool Failure**:
    - *Mistake*: All ChatGPT accounts in the vault had expired session tokens, causing every parallel image generation request to fail with `Sentinel handshake error: Sentinel prepare failed with HTTP 401: "Provided authentication token is expired. Please try signing in again."`. Because the engine tries all accounts in sequence and all fail, the entire pool silently fails and surfaces a generic 502.
    - *Lesson*: ChatGPT session tokens expire regularly. When a user reports all ChatGPT image/chat generation failing with 401, the fix is **user-side** — they must re-login to `chatgpt.com`, export fresh cookies/tokens via the Singularity Cookie Stacker, and re-paste into the vault. Do NOT attempt code fixes for authentication expiry. Diagnose token expiry immediately with `./singular accounts chatgpt` + `./singular limits` and tell the user which accounts need refreshing.

26. **Hardcoded Account Pool Count in Tavern UI Going Stale**:
    - *Mistake*: `GenerateExpressionSetDialog.tsx` had `(7 accounts pool)` hardcoded in the Parallel Processing label and `[1, 2, 3, 4, 7]` hardcoded in the concurrency button array. When the actual vault account count changed (e.g. only 6 accounts), the UI showed an incorrect number and allowed selecting more parallel streams than available accounts.
    - *Lesson*: Any UI label or button set that reflects the live account vault count **must** fetch the real count dynamically from `/api/services` (the `chatgpt.accounts` field). Use a `useEffect` on mount to hit `/api/services`, parse `data.services.find(s => s.id === 'chatgpt').accounts`, and store in a `useState`. Render the count only after it loads (hide until resolved). Cap the concurrency selector buttons to `maxConcurrency = gptAccountCount ?? fallback` so users can never attempt more parallel streams than they have accounts.

27. **Frontend JavaScript AST & Syntax Validation Before Shipping**:
    - *Mistake*: An unclosed parenthesis/bracket block inside an event handler in `singularity/static/app.js` caused a top-level `SyntaxError` at browser parse time, completely halting script execution and preventing event listeners (like the Settings gear icon modal trigger `#btn-open-settings`) from binding.
    - *Lesson*: Always run `node --check singularity/static/app.js` (or equivalent AST check) immediately after modifying frontend script files before concluding work. Verify that all initializers execute cleanly without unhandled syntax or runtime errors.
